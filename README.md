# 🔢 **VPC IP Formula (CIDR → Number of Hosts)**

### ✅ **Formula**

```
Number of IPs = 2^(32 – CIDR)
```

### 🧮 **Usable IPs**

```
Usable IPs = Total IPs – 5
```

AWS reserves **5 IPs per subnet**:

* Network address
* VPC router
* DNS
* AWS Reserved
* Broadcast (not used but reserved)

---

# 📝 **Examples**

### ⭐ **1. CIDR: /16**

```
Total IPs = 2^(32–16)
          = 2^16
          = 65,536
Usable = 65,536 – 5 = 65,531
```

---

### ⭐ **2. CIDR: /20**

```
Total IPs = 2^(32–20)
          = 2^12
          = 4096
Usable = 4096 – 5 = 4091
```

---

### ⭐ **3. CIDR: /24**

```
Total IPs = 2^(32–24)
          = 2^8
          = 256
Usable = 256 – 5 = 251
```

---

# 📘 **Subnet Formula (General)**

### **Network Size**

```
Block Size = 256 – Subnet Mask Value
```

Example:
Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0 → Last octet = 0
Block Size = 256 – 0 = 256

For /26 → mask 255.255.255.192
192 in last octet → Block Size = 256 – 192 = 64

---

# 📦 Quick Table

| CIDR | Total IPs | Usable IPs |
| ---- | --------- | ---------- |
| /16  | 65,536    | 65,531     |
| /20  | 4,096     | 4,091      |
| /22  | 1,024     | 1,019      |
| /24  | 256       | 251        |
| /26  | 64        | 59         |
| /28  | 16        | 11         |

# AWS VPC Complete Course

Welcome to the comprehensive AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) course! This course will take you from beginner to advanced levels in understanding and implementing AWS VPC networking.

## 📚 Course Overview

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a fundamental service that allows you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. This course covers everything from basic concepts to advanced networking scenarios.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will be able to:
- Understand VPC architecture and core components
- Design and implement custom VPCs from scratch
- Configure routing, security, and connectivity
- Implement hybrid cloud networking solutions
- Apply AWS VPC best practices and security standards
- Troubleshoot common VPC networking issues

## 👥 Target Audience

- Cloud Engineers and Architects
- DevOps Engineers
- Network Engineers transitioning to cloud
- AWS Solutions Architects preparing for certification
- Anyone wanting to master AWS networking

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of networking concepts (IP addressing, subnets, routing)
- AWS account (Free tier is sufficient for most labs)
- AWS CLI installed and configured (optional but recommended)
- Basic familiarity with AWS Console

## 🗂️ Course Structure

### Module 1: VPC Fundamentals
- Introduction to AWS VPC
- CIDR Blocks and IP Addressing
- Subnets (Public and Private)
- Availability Zones
- Default VPC vs Custom VPC

### Module 2: Routing and Internet Connectivity
- Route Tables
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
- NAT Gateway and NAT Instance
- Egress-Only Internet Gateway

### Module 3: VPC Security
- Security Groups
- Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
- Security Group vs NACL Comparison
- Best Practices for VPC Security

### Module 4: VPC Connectivity
- VPC Peering
- AWS Transit Gateway
- VPN Connections
- AWS Direct Connect
- AWS PrivateLink

### Module 5: Advanced VPC Topics
- VPC Endpoints (Gateway and Interface)
- VPC Flow Logs
- DNS in VPC
- DHCP Options Sets
- IPv6 in VPC
- Network Firewall

### Module 6: Hands-On Labs
- Lab 1: Create a Basic VPC
- Lab 2: Build a Multi-Tier Architecture
- Lab 3: Implement VPC Peering
- Lab 4: Configure VPN Connection
- Lab 5: Setup VPC Endpoints
- Lab 6: Implement Network Security

## 🛠️ Tools and Resources

- AWS Management Console
- AWS CLI
- CloudFormation Templates (included)
- Terraform Scripts (included)
- Network Diagram Tools

## 📖 How to Use This Course

1. Start with Module 1 and progress sequentially
2. Read the theory in each module
3. Follow along with the hands-on labs
4. Review the diagrams and architecture patterns
5. Practice with the provided CloudFormation templates
6. Complete the exercises at the end of each module

## 💰 Cost Considerations

Most labs in this course can be completed within the AWS Free Tier. However:
- NAT Gateway incurs charges (~$0.045/hour)
- VPN Connections incur charges (~$0.05/hour)
- Data transfer charges may apply
- Always clean up resources after labs

## 📝 Certification Alignment

This course content aligns with:
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
- AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Specialty
- AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate
